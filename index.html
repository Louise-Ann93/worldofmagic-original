                be a Professor yourself and teach young minds or an Auror. The best way to learn about them is not from a
                textbook. That's not how we teach here at the Academy. You'll get first class, first hand experience all

            <h2 class="header-4">Litmorths, Academy of Witchcraft</h2>
            <p class="snippet-4">Litmorths castle is a 19th-century romantic eclecticism palace on a rugged hill above
                the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany. While Litmorth’s look is that of a
                medieval castle, it was equipped inside with state of the art technology of it's time. With its large
                grounds for our Students to study about Magical Creatures or learn the sport of Quddich. Inside
                Litmorths Castle has 200 classrooms to cater for all our students needs. Home cooked meals made daily by House
                Elves will keep you well fed. Our Water is supplied by a nearby spring situated at only 200 meters above the
                castle.
                <br>
				<br>
                Litmorth’s positioning is also a fairytale one. It is located in the Alps, in a magnificent landscape,
                on the top of a hill. Litmorths overlooks the Hohenschwangau valley. While at Litmorths, you will be amazed
                by the extremely beautiful landscape that surrounds it.
